We believe that the nim language could be the most productive development solution for IT infrastructure projects.
The language produces C code & is very easy to develop in, our first attempts look very promising.

# FAQ

- why not golang
    - we do a lot in golang, its a great language with lots of support but sometimes the language is not close enough to system.
    - we believe nim has the potential to be faster than golang and also more productive (subjective!)
    - the biggest upside here though is the community support, its incredible, whish this existing for nimlang.
- why not rust
    - we personally find it too complex and as such not productive enough
- why not C(++)
    - nimlang = C only 10x more productive
- why not Java/C#/...
    - too much boilerplate, too much for not enough results (again personal opinion)
- why not python
    - we use it a lot as automation language and its great but not suitable for systems development (too slow)
    - we hope nim becomes mature enough so we can rewrite part of our python work (python is very dynamic though)
- do you believe nim is mature enough to develop professional IT platform systems with it today?
    - almost there, but this is the reason we are creating this nimscale project to hopefully help adoption & make it easier to work with external C components.
- what do we personally like in nimlang
    - the macro feature = metaprogramming, when used properly a very powerful way to create code
    - incredible nice syntax, very concise
    - good checks at compile time, avoid bugs
    - performance
    - low memory/system footprint
    - access to C libraries & system (IO)
    - few limitations, thanks to the metaprogramming features anything is possible really, different memory garbage collectors, datastructures, ...
- what can be improved?
    - community support not big enough yet, but growing
    - still changing all the time, hard to follow, often things still break


# how do we work together

- There is a group of developers working together on these projects you can find them on telegram group, [click here to join](https://t.me/joinchat/AAAAAAlYWlKyTifyZBfEVg)
- ALL work is done directly on the repo's using standard github practices
- We are looking for component owners (owners per repo) which will do the verification & coordination
- GreenITGlobe is willing to sponsor a certain amount of work, if you are a professional skilled developer and you would like to contribute on a very frequent basis on this project then please contact  us on info@greenitglobe.com
    - we pay through BitCoins & Upwork
- We want to endorse an open style of working, you need to be comfortable working with peers on telegram & github, we will do weekly zoom meetings (like skype but more efficient) to discuss progress & issues, telegram will be used to announce.
- look at our [milestones](https://github.com/nimscale/home/issues)

Hope to see you soon on our telegram group.
